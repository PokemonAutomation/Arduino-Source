/*  Watchdog
 *
 *  From: https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/
 *
 *      This class runs callbacks at specified intervals. The user can also
 *  delay the next call.
 *
 *  The primary use case here is watchdog timers. If nothing happens within a
 *  time window, fire a callback to sound an alarm. But if something does
 *  happen, delay it since there's nothing wrong.
