// Get which direction the player is facing by detecting the direction of the red arrow on the map.
// The orientation is measured by the angle to the positive x-axis direction on the screen image.
// The image x-axis points to the right, and y-axis points downward.
// e.g south-east direction is measured as 45 degree.
// Range of the orientation: [0, 360), or FLT_MAX if sth. wrong happens.
//
// Notes:
// - The red arrow won't be occluded by lables on the map.
// - Due to the lava being red on the map too, this function does not work if the player is inside
//   the volcano area in the coastlands when viewing the map in zoom level 1 (whole region view).
//   It also does not work if the player is near the volcano area when viewing the map in zoom level
//   2 (local area view). If `avoid_lava_area` is true, skip the red pixels that are in the upper right
//   area of the map, which is well the lava area is on the coastlands map at zoom level 1.
