/*  Time Sample Buffer
 *
 *  From: https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/
 *
 *
 *  This is a buffer for raw audio samples taken from an audio input.
 *
 *  It will store at least "history" worth of samples before dropping old data.
 *
 *  This class isn't just a trivial circular buffer. It allows random write
 *  and random read access. Reads will intelligently try to construct a
 *  contiguous audio stream. If it can't, it will insert zeros or drop samples
 *  where appropriate to correct it.
 *
 *  This class in effect, is fault-tolerant to interruptions by both the writer
 *  and reader(s). Gaps or delays will self-correct to avoid a situation where
 *  the reader(s) perpetually fall behind or get ahead of the writers. Drifts
 *  where the writer/reader(s) are of slightly different speeds will also be
 *  corrected.
 *
 *
 *  Both read and write access to the buffer is done by blocks with a timestamp
 *  indicating the approximate time of the latest sample in the block.
 *
 *  If you need to read data contiguously, you need to use TimeSampleBufferReader
 *  to read it as it will ensure that the samples are contiguous across
 *  successive read calls.
