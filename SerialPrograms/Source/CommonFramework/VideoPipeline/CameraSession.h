/*  Camera Session
 *
 *  From: https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/Arduino-Source
 *
 *      CameraSession represents a live camera. It holds onto a Camera object
 *  and can be started/stopped/queried, etc...
 *
 *  This class is not responsible for any UI. However, any changes made to this
 *  class will be forwarded to any UI components that are attached to it.
 *
 *  The UI that allows a user to control this class is in CameraSelectorWidget.
 *  The actual display of the video from the camera is in VideoDisplayWidget.
