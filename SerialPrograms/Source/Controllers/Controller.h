    //  everything. The intended use-case is for an inference thread to cancel
    //  a running sequence of commands on a program thread.
    //

    //  Cancel all commands. This returns the controller to the neutral button
    //  state and clears the command queue.

    //  asynchronous function that merely initiates the cancellation process.

    //  Same as "cancel_all_commands()", but instead of cancelling the stream,
    //  it lets it keep running. Then on the next command issued after this
    //  cancel, it will atomically replace the stream without gapping.

    //  Commands
    //
    //  Commands are actions like button presses or joystick movements that are
    //  eventually sent to the console.
    //
    //  All commands are prefixed with "issue_".
    //  Commands are not thread-safe with other commands.
    //  Commands are thread-safe with the cancellation functions above.
    //
    //  Commands are asynchronous. When you call a command function on this,
    //  class it gets enqueued into a FIFO and immediately returns. It will only
    //  block if the FIFO is full.
    //
    //  If a command is called with a cancelled "cancellable" parameter, it will
    //  throw an OperationCancelledException.
    //  If a cancellation happens while you are inside a command function, it
    //  will immediately stop and throw an OperationCancelledException.

    //  Superscalar Commands (the "ssf" framework)
    //

    //
    //  delay       Time to wait before moving onto the next command.
    //  hold        Time to hold the button/stick down for.
    //  cooldown    After the button has been released, prevent it from being
    //              used again for this much time.
    //
    //  For "normal" use, you should always set (delay == hold + cooldown).
    //  This is the easiest case to understand and is what the "pbf" interface
    //  exposes.
    //
    //  If the button is busy (due to still being held down or is waiting out
    //  the cooldown), the command will wait until the button is ready.
    //
    //  By setting (delay < hold), the command will "return" early and move onto
    //  the next command while the button is still being held down.
    //
    //  If a command returns before it is finished (delay < hold + cooldown),
    //  it is considered a "hanging" command.
    //
    //  This allows you to overlap buttons. But is confusing to use because it
    //  implies a non-trivial controller state with pending button presses that
    //  are scheduled to be released at a later time.
    //
    //  Each button/stick has its own independent timeline/schedule.
    //  Users are responsible for understanding the controller state and
    //  managing the timeline/scheduling.
    //
    //  It is important to remember that the "timeline" here is the timeline
    //  being fed to the Switch. Thus the timing parameters written in the C++
    //  code here is what you will get on the console (or as close as possible).
    //
    //  The actual calls to the methods in the class will return or block in an
    //  unspecified manner as they merely enqueue into a FIFO which is then
    //  "replayed" to the Switch in an implementation-dependent manner.
    //

    //  Wait for all unfinished commands to finish. This will also wait out
    //  hanging commands including their cooldown periods.
    //  This is not a true command function as it waits for the entire queue to
    //  empty out rather than entering itself into the queue.
    //  If a cancellation happens inside this function, it will immediately
    //  throw an OperationCancelledException.

    //  Tell the scheduler to wait for all pending commands to finish
    //  (including cooldowns) before executing further instructions.
